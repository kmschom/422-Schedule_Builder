Name: schedule.py
Purpose: Creates Schedule class to hold information on individual scheduling variations and run scheduling algorithms to
build appointments.

Creation Date: Feb. 12, 2022

Authors: Mert YapucuoÄŸlu (my), Kelly Schombert (ks)

schedule.py is part of the All In a Week's Work (AWW) Schedule Building software which takes input on athlete and tutor
availability and builds a schedule of tutoring appointments for the entire group.
Called by:
    builder.py - calls Schedule class 100 times within _createSchedules to make and score multiple schedule iterations

Modifications:

Implemented required queue      ks, my 2/19/22
Implemented optional queue      ks 2/23/22
Implemented scoring system      my 2/24/22
