This system is called JTAS(JAQUA Tutoring Appointment Scheduler) and it is used for the John E. Jaqua Academic Center for Student Athletes (JAQUA) to schedule tutoring appointments for the University of Oregon’s student athletes. This system takes in two files, an athlete file and a tutor file. Both files contain the student’s first and last name, the id, hours wanted, and subjects. Based on the input files, our system will make a big csv file with all of the athletes’ appointments for the week including the time, day, subject, tutor name, and classroom. In addition, the user can get an individual student’s schedule.

This system was created because the JAQUA manually creates a schedule for all the tutors and all of the athletes for tutoring appointments then adds it to a huge calendar every week. This system takes a lot of time because it is all done manually.

To run this program, the user needs to go to their terminal by pressing the command key and then the space key then type in terminal and press enter. The user needs to download tkinter by typing in without the quotation marks “pip3 --version” then press enter “pip3 install --upgrade pip” then press enter “pip3 install tk” and then press enter. Navigate to where they download the source code, most likely in the downloads section of their computer. Type “cd Downloads” in the terminal and press enter. Type in the terminal, “cd Schedule_Builder” and press enter. Continuing in the terminal, type “python3 ScheduleSystem.py” and press enter. The user should follow the instructions from the prompts to use the system.

Should be run on Macintosh OS 11.2.3(Big Sur) or above.
There is a subdirectory named Schedule that is created while running the system. The Schedule directory includes the schedule.csv that has all of the appointments for the week, a text file of all the appointments, and an individual student’s appointments for the week.
